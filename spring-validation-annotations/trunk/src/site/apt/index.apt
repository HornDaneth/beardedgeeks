About Spring Validation Annotations

  The Spring Validation Annotations makes creation of Spring validators lots
  and lots easier! Using the built-in annotations you can annotate the fields
  in validatable objects with the restrictions you desire to have, and use
  their respective validators for validating the fields. It's as easy as
  1-2-3-4!
  
  An example:
  
+---+
@Validatable
public class Foo {
  @Required
  @MinLength(3)
  @MaxLength(10)
  @MatchesPattern("test.*")
  private String bar;
}
